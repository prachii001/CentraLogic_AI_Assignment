 The Indian rebellion was fed by resentment spawn of diverse perceptions, including invasive British-style social reforms, harsh land taxes, summary treatment of some rich landowners and princes, and skepticism about the improvements brought about by British rule. Many Indians rose against the British, however, many also fought for the British, and the majority remained seemingly compliant to British rule. Americans, which sometimes betrayed exceptional cruelty, was inflicted on both sides, on British officers, and civilians, including women and children. By the rebels, and on the rebels, and their supporters, including sometimes entire villages. By British reprisals, the cities of Delhi and Lucknow were laid waste in the fighting and the British retaliation after the outbreak of the mutiny in Mirat. The rebels quickly reached Delhi, whose 81-year-old Mughal ruler, Baha'ja or Shaq Saqfa, was declared the Emperor of Hindustan. Soon, the rebels had captured large tracts of the northwestern provinces and a ward out. The East India Company's response came rapidly as well. With help from reinforcements, Kampa was retaken by mid-July 1857, and Delhi by the end of September. However, it then took the remainder of 1857 and the better part of 1858 for the rebellion to be suppressed in Jansi, Lucknow, and especially the award-country side. Other regions of Kampana controlled India, Bengal Province, the Bombay Presidency, and the Madras Presidency, remained largely calm. In the Punjab, the Sikh princes crucially helped the British by providing both soldiers and support. The large princely states, Hyderabad, Mizor, Travancor, and Kashmir, as well as the smaller ones of Rajputana, did not join the rebellion, serving the British, in the Governor-General Lord Kaning's words, as break waters in a storm.
